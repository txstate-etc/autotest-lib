# autotest-lib
Platform agnostic testing library for common CI, development, app, and API tests along with any common tooling to aid in developing and running tests.

This is intended as a space for putting different test suite routines that are commonly tested for in our different projects. It's agnostic in the test suite platforms its targeted for but will have sub-modules for each of the testing suites we'd like to provide standardized common tests for.

Within the suite specific modules functions that implement common tests will be provided along with any tooling and common `anonymous` seed data that may be useful across multiple coding projects.
